#Things to do
#import logging
#fix z axis flip from pygame to local coord system
#have a scale for drawing in pygame that is independent of bug kinematics


#have a sample period so can do velocity
#simulate collision dynamics to mimic accelerometer
#kinematics for zumo
#kinematics for gopigo

#range
#collisions could do damage
#minimize energy spent
#maximize health


#Bug
#knows how to move
#holds attributes
#has a brain
#has sensors
#has outputs

#Bug parts
#has a shape, size, color, location(relative to base), hitbox(relative to location)
#knows how to draw itself
#knows what type of collisions to register for
